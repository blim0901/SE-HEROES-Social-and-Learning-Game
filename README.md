# SE-HEROES-Social-and-Learning-Game
The purpose of this project is to create a standalone application SEHeroes, that serves as a learning, teaching and gaming platform that allows students to learn the knowledge of Software Development Life Cycle(SLDC) and provides teachers a teaching platform where they can add questions and give assignments to students. Our team aims to develop a game app that can complement teachersâ€™ teachings through game plays.  SEHeroes provides a monster-fighting game theme user interface that allows users to explore a world full of monsters. Each world represents a life cycle of the SDLC, and students will need to answer questions in mainly MCQ format in order to defeat the monsters. It enables students to recap and learn by going through questions in a form of battling enemies as they move across levels. Leaderboard in the game gives students a rough idea of how they are doing compared to the rest. Whereas the teachers will have their workload reduced as the app provides auto-grading upon level completion. Teachers will be able to assign weekly assignments to students to keep track of their weekly progress and subsequently generate a report to overview the performance of their students. SE-HEROES operates using the Google Firebase Firestore for backend development, and also Unity (C#) for frontend game development.
